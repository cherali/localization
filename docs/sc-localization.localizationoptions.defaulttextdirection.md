## LocalizationOptions.defaultTextDirection property

default text direction, if you want to prioritize a text direction, mainly for rtl languages

this is useful when you have lots of `rtl` text direction locales, and few ltr text direction locales

if you have lots of `ltr` text direction locales, you don't need to set this

the `localeDirection` getter uses textDirection object and this direction to find the text direction

setting this to `ltr` is not necessarily, because if you don't set this, the default value is `ltr`

**Signature:**

```typescript
readonly defaultTextDirection?: Directions;
```
