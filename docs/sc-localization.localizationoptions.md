_(Optional)_ you have lowercase partition name and want to uppercase that partition when retrieve those partition

only works if enablePartition is true

default locale, this must be one of items in locales array

[Directions](./sc-localization.directions.md)


</td><td>

_(Optional)_ default text direction, if you want to prioritize a text direction, mainly for rtl languages

this is useful when you have lots of `rtl` text direction locales, and few ltr text direction locales

if you have lots of `ltr` text direction locales, you don't need to set this

the `localeDirection` getter uses textDirection object and this direction to find the text direction

setting this to `ltr` is not necessarily, because if you don't set this, the default value is `ltr`

[enablePartition?](./sc-localization.localizationoptions.enablepartition.md)

boolean


</td><td>

_(Optional)_ whether you want to have multiple files for language or have single file for a language.

if you want separate your translation set this to true

[TextDirectionObject](./sc-localization.textdirectionobject.md)<!-- -->&lt;T&gt;


</td><td>

_(Optional)_ text direction for locales

you just need to set the locale that have a different text direction than `defaultTextDirection` (which is `ltr` by default)

if `defaultTextDirection` is not set, any locale that is `NOT` in this object will have `ltr` text direction, so you just need to define `rtl` locales in this object

if `defaultTextDirection` is set to `rtl`<!-- -->, any locale that is `NOT` in this object will have `rtl` text direction, so you just need to define `ltr` locales in this object

setting `defaultTextDirection` is to `ltr` is NOT useful, and if you have lots of `ltr` text direction you can remove this, by setting this to `ltr` you need to define all locales that have `rtl` text direction

also you can set all locales with text direction, but you don't need to do this

so, if you have lots of `ltr` text direction locales, just set define the locales that have `rtl` text direction in this object if you have lots of `rtl` text direction locales, first set `defaultTextDirection` to `rtl`<!-- -->, then define the locales that have `ltr` text direction in this object

the `localeDirection` getter first use this object for returning the text direction, thus if you set `en` to `rtl` in this object, localeDirection will return `rtl`

string \| number


</td><td>

_(Optional)_ first of all, this is a client thing only, and only works for client localization.

because client localization use fetch to get translation, and browsers cache the responses, on each build you may change the translation file (add, remove), so you need a way to invalidate the cache, to do that, you can use this property.

you can pass any unique number or string like timestamp, or your app version, this property will be added as a query parameter to the fetch url.

if you set this to undefined or you don't set this, the url will be cleaned of any query parameter even question mark, in the case you want to handle cache by yourself, you can remove this flag in options.
